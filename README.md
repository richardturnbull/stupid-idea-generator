# Stupid Idea Generator

## Why?

So, being a ~~DevOps Engineer~~ Site Reliability Engineer, I spend a lot of time reading about new technologies,
frameworks, languages, deploy methods (and so on...) and how they make everything so easy, simple, scalable, fast etc...

While most of the time these claims are true (to some extent), I do find that unless you've used something "in anger"
you probably don't know it as well as you think you do. (At least not well enough to be able to speak intelligently about what
tradeoffs it makes to get its ease of use, simplicity, scalability etc...)

So, the best way to try something out is to use it to build something!!! But, what to build?... ðŸ¤”

That's where the "Stupid Idea Generator" comes in! Just run the python code below and it will generate an idea for you
to build (or at least give you a starting point, from which you can "pivot").

## How to run

I've only tested this with Python3, but it should work with Python2 because it's really simple.

```
python3 dumb-idea.py
```

## Output

Currently has the output format:

```
It's like [PRODUCT/COMPANY] for [INDUSTRY/TECH]

e.g.

It's like Instagram for Distributed Systems
```
